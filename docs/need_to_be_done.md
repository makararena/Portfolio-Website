Here’s how to include the **toggle button** for switching between **Hard Skills** and **Soft Skills**, with three sections for each:

---

### Updated **Skills Section**:

### 2. **Skill Subcategories**
- **Add a toggle button** to switch between **Hard Skills** and **Soft Skills**. The skills layout should dynamically update based on the selected category.
- Structure:

#### **Default View: Hard Skills**
  - **BI Systems:**
    - Power BI
    - Metabase
    - Tableau
  - **Analytics Tools:**
    - Google Analytics 4
  - **Programming Languages:**
    - Python
    - SQL
    - C++
    - Java

#### **Soft Skills View (On Toggle):**
  - **Communication:**
    - Clear, professional communication in English and Polish.
    - Presenting analytical findings to stakeholders.
  - **Problem-Solving:**
    - Strategic thinking for data-driven decision-making.
    - Identifying bottlenecks in analytics workflows.
  - **Team Collaboration:**
    - Coordinating with cross-functional teams.
    - Agile collaboration in fast-paced environments.

---

### Implementation Notes:
1. **Toggle Button Behavior:**
   - The toggle button should dynamically change the displayed content when clicked.
   - Example: "Show Hard Skills" → Displays Hard Skills.  
     "Show Soft Skills" → Displays Soft Skills.
   - Add a smooth transition for visual appeal when switching between the two views.

2. **UI Design:**
   - The toggle button can be styled as a switch or tabbed buttons (e.g., "Hard Skills" | "Soft Skills").
   - Ensure the button is easily noticeable and accessible.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Design the section in a modular way so additional categories (e.g., "Leadership Skills") can be added in the future without breaking the layout.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the toggle and skill categories are responsive for both mobile and desktop views.

---

### Example Interaction Flow:
1. User clicks the **Soft Skills** button.
2. The skills section dynamically updates to display **Soft Skills** with the three subsections.
3. User clicks the **Hard Skills** button to return to the original view.
